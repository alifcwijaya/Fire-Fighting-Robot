# Fire-Fighting-Robot
Ujang is a line-following type robot equipped with advanced sensors and mechanisms to detect and extinguish fires.

Project Overview:

The Ujang robot is a line-following type robot equipped with advanced sensors and mechanisms to detect and extinguish fires. It utilizes a two-gear servo-driven turret equipped with a high-speed fan to put out flames when detected by a photodiode sensor. The robotâ€™s movement is governed by a PID-controlled system for precise navigation along a black line, while two Arduino Uno microcontrollers handle both motion control and fire extinguishing functions.

Key features of Ujang:

Line Following: Using 5 TCRT5000 sensors to follow the black line.
Fire Detection: Photodiode sensor for flame detection, triggering the turret and fan.
Fire Extinguishing: A turret with two stacked servos and a fan motor for extinguishing fire.
PID Control: Ensures smooth and accurate movement along the line.
High Speed: Achieved a high speed with a completion time of just 41 seconds.
